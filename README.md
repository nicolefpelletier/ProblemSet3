Problem Set 3:
This should be turned in as a public github repository with your code either in scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.

 

You may work on this in groups, but each person should submit their own answers.

 

Note: This assignment will have peer review. It is important to be able to look at someone else's code and figure out what they are doing. It's also important to write code with the idea that someone else will look at it and needs to understand it. While I will take both the peer reviewer's comments on your code and your comments on the peer reviewed code into account when assigning grades, I will be assigning the grade, not the reviewer.

Data:
The data file for this problem set is at: 

  /ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv

  It is also in the Class_Files git repo here (Links to an external site.)

  The metadata file for this file is here (Links to an external site.).

 

Problem 1 (4 pts):
Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that opens the file, uses a for loop to read through the file line by line and reports the highest water level and the date and time that was observed.

 

Problem 2 (4 pts):
Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that reads the file into a Pandas dataframe and reports the highest water level and the date and time that was observed.

 

Problem 3 (4 pts):
Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that calculates the fastest rise in water level per 6-minute period between measurements (for this assignment, assume that each line of the dataset is a 6-minute interval) and reports the data and time that was observed and the change in water level during that period. You can use line by line or dataframe for this.

 

Problem 4: Grad students only (4 pts): 
Grad students only (undergrads get 4 pts automatically).

Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that plots a line graph of water level over time using matplotlib.

 

Problem 5: Peer Review (4 pts):
Each person will review one other persons answers and leave comments. 

If the code works for the reviewer and produces the desired result, they will say so.

If it doesn't work they will try to figure out why and suggest a fix.

If the reviewer can understand the code, its logic and what you are doing they will say so.

If the reviewer can't understand what you were doing, they will suggest where things are confusing and how to improve.

 

Extra Credit (4 pts):
Using the Web Services Button on this page (Links to an external site.) as a guide and/or the API description (Links to an external site.), write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) to download data from Panama City, Fl for "today" e.i. whenever the code is run, get that day's data.
